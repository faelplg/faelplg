## About me

Experienced product developer of technology-based solutions within the software industry, with strengths in strategic management, process-oriented management, solution architectures, and user experience. Achieved extensive technical knowledge within the software development area, starting my career in full-stack development and, over time, specializing in web development and user experience.

Currently working as a manager in the elaboration, implementation, and monitoring of the strategic planning and IT governance.

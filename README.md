<!-- Bio -->
## About me

I have been the Director of Technology at Aurum for over 3 years, with more than 12 years of experience as a programmer and over 8 years in technology leadership roles. I built my career in the software industry, developing products and applying methodologies in strategic management, solution architecture, agile practices, and user experience engineering.

With a degree in Systems Analysis and specializations in UX Engineering, Front-End Development, and Process Management, I have a solid foundation that supports my professional journey. My interest in creative programming and entrepreneurship led me to co-found two companiesâ€”one of which had a successful exitâ€”and to successfully deliver over 10 digital products, acting both as a developer and as a manager. I have also contributed to the public sector as a technology manager.

I began my career as a Full-Stack Developer, specializing in web development and UX. My experience ranges from creating simple websites to developing complex applications, focusing on micro-interactions, layout architectures, and creative coding.

Currently, I lead the strategic planning and IT governance of a 50-person team. I have experience with methodologies like Balanced Scorecard, Process Management, Project Management, OKRs, and Scrum. I strive to implement service-oriented operations with well-defined processes, promoting fluid and understandable business process management for teams and stakeholders.

Driven by curiosity and a desire to evolve, I am exploring the field of cybersecurity. I study intensively, apply my knowledge within the company, and continuously seek new challenges to expand my expertise and contribute innovative solutions in the technological landscape.
